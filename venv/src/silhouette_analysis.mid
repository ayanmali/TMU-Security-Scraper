## These plots show the silhouette curves for a given number of clusters K, where 2 <= K <= 9.

As the number of clusters increases, the average silhouette score continues to decrease. Moreover, for a statistically useful clustering, the size of the clusters should be relatively close as well.
With these in mind, a K value of 3 appears to be a good number of clusters, as the size of clusters is relatively equal and the silhouette score is higher compared to other possible K values.
